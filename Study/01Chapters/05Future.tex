\chapter{Further Topics}

From our understanding our Fourier analysis in the circle, line and for special classes of holomorphic functions, we can step into a world of further analysis where answers to seemingly simple problems are still hidden. In this chapter we will discuss some of them and try to understand what tools are required for them. This will be a brief outlook into the future of the topic presenting some open problems and probing directions for further research.

\section{Fourier Transforms in $\R^n$}
Before we begin our analysis on $\R^n$, unlike $\R$, we define a new class of functions called the Schwartz functions.

\begin{definition}[Schwartz Class]
\label{def:schwartz_class}
A smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{C}$, $f$ is called a \emph{Schwartz function} if for any given multi index $\alpha, \beta$, there exists a positive constant $C_{\alpha, \beta}$ such that $$\rho_{\alpha, \beta} = \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \left|x^\alpha (D^\beta f)x \right| = C_{\alpha, \beta} < \infty$$ 
Here $\rho_{\alpha, \beta}(f)$ is called \emph{Schwartz seminorm of $f$}. The collection of all such functions is called the \emph{Schwartz space} of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and is denoted by $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. 
See \autocite[Appendix A.3]{perko_differential_2001} for definition of multi index and derivative.
\end{definition}

Now let us define Fourier transform for a funtion in $\mathscr{S}(\R^n)$
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:fourier_transform_in_Rn}
  Let $f \in \mathscr{S}(\R^n)$, then we define the Fourier transform of $f$, as $$\hatf(t) = \int_{\R^n} f(x) e^{-2\pi i t\cdot x} \ dx $$
  where $x \cdot y$ denote the standard inner product in $\R^n$.
\end{definition}

Notice that $\hatf$ is well defined since $$\left|\hatf(t)\right| \le \int_{\R^n} \left|f(x) e^{-2\pi i t\cdot x}\right| \ dx \le \int_{\R^n} \left|f(x)\right| \ dx  = \|f\|_1$$


We'll try to look into \emph{Functions whose Fourier transform vanishes on the sphere} from \autocite[Problem no. 3]{Grafakos2017a}

\begin{problem}[Functions whose Fourier transforms vanishes on the sphere]
\label{prb:research_problem}
Let $n \ge 2$. Does there exist a function $f \in L^{\frac{2n+2}{n+3}}(\R^n)$ such that $$\hatf\vert_{S^{n-1}} = 0$$
and
$$\left| 1 - |\xi|^2\right|^{-\frac{1}{2}}f \notin L^2(\R^n)$$
\end{problem}

In order to analyse this problem we need a little more tools in our disposal. The main one among them is Schwartz functions. 

The reason why Schwartz class is an attractive space for Fourier analysis is because Fourier transform is a homeomorphism on the Schwartz class \autocite[Corollary 2.2.15]{Grafakos_Classical_Fourier}

We instantly notice the similarity of Problem \autoref{prb:research_problem} with another famous problem called the 'Restriction Conjecture' proposed by Elias M Stein.

\begin{problem}

\end{problem}

Next theorem which will aid us is the Stein-Tomas theorem.
